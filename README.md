# Hackintosh Catalina

### Main Specs:
	* Asus rog strix z390-f Motherboard
	* Intel core i7-9700k
	* iGpu
	* 16GB DDR4 3500mhz
  
**Note:**
If you have the same config just copy paste Efi folder (If it does not boot try to regenerate SSDTTime)

If you have different processor you need to change ig-platform-id.
I also suggest you to follow [this](https://hackintosher.com/guides/guide-to-fresh-installing-macos-catalina-on-a-hackintosh/)
for creating your PERSONAL efi folder.

Leave a star if it has been useful :)
